<h2>Description</h2>
A secret auction is an auction where people write secret bids on a piece of paper, and whoever has the highest bid wins the item. Silent auctions are auctions held without an auctioneer. People place their bids on sheets of paper instead. They're often used by charities to raise money, but they can be tricky to put together. With good planning, however, it's easy to set up an auction and get the most out of your items. Soon enough, you'll have raised a good amount of money in just a few hours!
